# SPATIAL AUDIO MURDER MYSTERY
ECE4760 Final Project

By using the Raspberry Pi Pico, this project implements spatial audio into a fun and interactive murder mystery game. We generated self-recorded audio and passed it to headphones while applying a spatial audio algorithm to the input audio. To the headphone user, the audio appears to be coming from the specific direction the user chooses with the joystick. The goal is to closely mimic how sounds in real life reach our ears, depending on where the sound is coming from.
